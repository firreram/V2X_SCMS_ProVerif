# V2X SCMS ProVerif Model

This repository contains a formal model of the **Security Credential Management System (SCMS)** for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. The model is written in **ProVerif**, a protocol verifier for analyzing the security of cryptographic protocols.

## ðŸ§  Project Goal

The goal of this project is to verify the **privacy** and **authentication** guarantees provided by the SCMS protocol, focusing specifically on:

- **Pseudonym Certificate Provisioning**
- **Misbehavior Detection and Revocation**

The analysis is performed using the **ProVerif** tool to detect potential attacks, such as:
- Linkability of pseudonyms
- Identity disclosure
- Misuse of revocation mechanisms
